# zpaqfranz: advanced multiversioned archiver, with HW acceleration and SFX (on Windows)      

### Swiss army knife for backup and disaster recovery, like 7z or RAR on steroids, with deduplicated "snapshots" (versions). Conceptually similar to Mac's time machine but much more efficient. zpaq 7.15 fork.

## Classic file archivers (tar, 7z, RAR etc) are obsolete when used for repeated backups (daily, weekly, etc) compared to the ZPAQ algorithm that maintains "snapshots" (versions) of the data. [This is even more true in the case of ASCII dumps of databases (e.g. MySQL/MariaDB)](https://github.com/fcorbelli/zpaqfranz/wiki/Real-world:-SQL-dumps-(MySQL-MariaDB-Postgres-backup))

Let's see.
Archiving a folder multiple times (5), simulating a daily run Monday-to-Friday, with 7z:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77727889/215149589-0f2d9f91-ea5a-4f60-b587-f2a506148fe9.mp4

Same, but with zpaqfranz:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77727889/215148702-edb8e5bb-8f4e-42bb-9637-6ee98742318a.mp4

_As you can see, the .7z "daily" 5x backups takes ~ 5x the space of the .zpaq_ ones.

![compare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77727889/215150599-83032cc6-06b0-432d-ba3b-b410698e3631.jpg)

## Seeing is believing ("real world")

I thought it's best to show the difference with a more realistic example.  

Physical (small fileserver) Xeon machine with 8 cores, 64GB RAM and NVMe disks, plus Solaris-based NAS, 1Gb ethernet

Rsync update from filesystem to filesystem (real speed):

# What?

At every run only data changed since the last execution will be added, creating a new version (the "snapshot").
It is then possible to restore the data @ the single version, just like snapshots by zfs or virtual machines, but a single-file level.  
- Keeps a forever-to-ever copy (even thousands of versions), conceptually similar to Mac's time machine, but much more efficiently.  
- Ideal for virtual machine disk storage (ex backup of vmdk), virtual disks (VHDx) and even TrueCrypt containers.  
- Easily handles millions of files and tens of TBs of data.  
- Allows rsync (or zfs replica) copies to the cloud with minimal data transfer and encryption.    
- Multiple possibilities of data verification, fast, advanced and even paranoid.
- Some optimizations for modern hardware (aka: SSD, NVMe, multithread).
- By default triple-check with "chunked" SHA-1, XXHASH64 and CRC-32 (!).  

```
For even higher level of paranoia, it is possible to use others hash algorithms, as
```
- MD5
- SHA-1 of the full-file (NIST FIPS 180-4)
- XXH3-128
- BLAKE3 128
- SHA-2-256 (NIST FIPS 180-4)
- SHA-3-256 (NIST FIPS 202)
- WHIRLPOOL (ISO/IEC 10118-3)
- HIGHWAY (64,128,256)
...And much more.  


**No complex (and fragile) repository folders, with hundreds of "whatever", just only a single file!**  

## Windows client? Minimum size (without software) VSS backups

_It is often important to copy the %desktop% folder, Thunderbird's data, %download% and generally the data folders of a Windows system, leaving out the programs._

Real speed (encrypted) update of C: without software (-frugal):  

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77727889/215269540-8e2c8641-0d3a-4f67-a243-ab617834c5de.mp4

## Are you a really paranoid Windows user (like me)? You can get sector-level copies of C:, too.

_In this case the space used is obviously larger, as is the execution time, but even the "most difficult" folders are also taken. Deliberately the bitmap of occupied clusters is ignored: If you are paranoid, be all the way down!_  

_It is just like dd; you can't (for now) restore with zpaqfranz. You have to extract to a temporary folder and then use other software (e.g., 7z, OSFMount) to extract the files directly from the image_

Accelerated speed (encrypted) every-sector update of a 256GB C: @ ~150MB/s:

### To date, there is no software, free or paid, that matches these characteristics.  
_AFAIK of course._  
10+ years of developing (2009-now).

**Who made that?**

One of the world's leading scientists in compression.

[No, not me, but this guy](http://mattmahoney.net/) [ZPAQ - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPAQ)

**When?**

From 2009 to 2016.

**Where?**

On a [Russian compression forum](https://encode.su/threads/456-zpaq-updates), one of the most famous, but obviously super-niche.

**Why is it not known as 7z or RAR, despite being enormously superior?**

Due to a lack of users who ... Try it!

**Who are you?**

A user (and a developer) who has proposed and made various improvements to ZPAQ that have been implemented over the years.
When the author left the project, I made this fork to make the functions I need as a data storage manager.

**Why is it no longer developed? Why should I use your fork?**

Because Dr. Mahoney is now retired and no longer supports it (he... Runs!)

**Why should I trust this? This will be among the 1000 other programs that silently fail and raise problems.**

As the Russians (and Italians) say: Trust me; but check!

**Archiving data requires safety. How can I be sure that I can then extract them without problems?**

It is precisely the portion of the program that I have evolved, implementing a barrage of controls up to the paranoid level and more.
Let's say there are verification mechanisms which you have probably never seen. Do you want to use SHA-2/SHA-3 to be very confident? You can.

Accelerated speed of real world testing of archive >1GB/s:

**ZPAQ (zpaqfranz) allows you to NEVER delete data that is stored and will be available forever (in reality, you typically start from scratch every 1,000 or 2,000 or so versions for speed reasons an on HDD. 10K+ on SSD), and restore the files present to each archived version, even if a month or three years ago.**


Real-speed updating (on QNAP NAS) of a small server (300GB); ~7GB of Thunderbird mbox become ~6MB (!) in ~4 minutes:

In this "real world" example (a ~500.000 files / ~500GB file server of a mid-sized enterprise), you will see 1042 "snapshots", stored in 877GB.

214.379.664.412 (199.66 GB) of 214.379.664.412 (199.66 GB) in 154.975 files shown
```
so for 4900 versions you need
200GB*4900 = ~980TB with something like tar, 7z, RAR etc (yes, 980 terabytes),
versus ~200GB (yes, 200GB) with zpaq.

Same things for virtual machines (vmdks).

## Why do you say uniqueness? We got (hb) hashbackup, borg, restic, bupstash, etc. ##

Because other software (sometimes very, very well made) runs on complex "repositories". Very fragile and way too hard to manage (at least for my tastes).  
It may happen that you have to worry about backing up ... the backup. Maybe some files were lost during a transfer, corrupted, etc.  
_If it's simple, maybe it will work._

## Too good to be true? ##

Obviously this is not "magic", it is simply the "chaining" of a block deduplicator with a compressor and an archiver.
There are faster compressors.
There are better compressors.
There are faster archivers.
There are more efficient deduplicators.

But what I have never found is a combination of these four that is dead simple to use and reliable, with excellent handling of non-Latin filenames (Chinese, Russian, etc).

This is the key: You don't have to do complex "piping" with tar | srep | zstd | _something_ hoping that everything will work, but instead, all you have to use is a single ~4MB executable, with 7z-like commands.  
You don't even have to install a complex program with many dependencies that will have to read a folder (the repository) with maybe thousands of files, hoping that they will still be fully functional.

There are also many great features for backups, I mention only the greatest.  
**The ZPAQ file is "in addition" (appended), it is never actually modified.**

So rsync --append will copy only the new portion added, for example, in an ssh tunnel to a remote server, or local NAS (QNAP etc). Thus, file transfers are absurdly quick.  
TRANSLATION  
You can pay ~$4 a month for 1TB cloud-storage-space to store just about everything.

You don't have to copy or synchronize, let's say, 700GB of a tar.gz,7z or whatever, but only (say) the 2GB added to it in the last copy. The first 698GB remain untouched.

This opens up the concrete possibility of using VDSL connections (upload ~ 2/4MB /s) to backup even virtual servers hundreds of gigabytes big in just a few minutes.

In this (accelerated) video, the rsync transfer of 2 remote backups: "standard" .zpaq archive (file level) AND zfsbackup (bit-level) for a small real-world server 1 day-update of work:

**Bonus: for a developer it's just like a "super-git-versioning"**

In the makefile ,just put a zpaq-save-everything at the top and you will keep all the versions of your software, even with libraries, SQL dumps, etc.
A single archive keeps everything, forever, with just one command (or two, for verification).
    
**Defects?**

Some.

The main one is that the listing of files is not very fast, when there are many versions (thousands), due to the structure of the archiver-file-format. 
*I could get rid of it, but at the cost of breaking the backwards compatibility of the file format, so I don't want to. On versions 52+, there is a workaround (-filelist)*.

It is not the fastest tool out there, with real world performance of 80-200MB/s (depending on the case and HW of course).
*Not a big deal for me (I have very powerful HW, and/or run nightly cron-tasks)*

Extraction can require a number of seeks (due to various deduplicated blocks), which can slow down extraction on magnetic disks (but not on SSDs).  
*If you have plenty of RAM now it is possible to bypass with the w command*

No other significant ones come to mind, except that it is known and used by few

**Very hard to use?**  
It is a tool for power users and administrators, who are used to the command line. A text-based GUI is being developed to make data selection and complex extraction easier (!).  

In this example we want to extract all the .cpp files as .bak from the 1.zpaq archive. This is something you typically cannot do with other archives such as tar, 7z, rar etc.  
### With a "sort of" WYSIWYG 'composer' 
First **f** key (find) and entering .cpp  
Then **s** (search) every .cpp substring  
Then **r** (replace) with .bak  
Then **t** (to) for the z:\example folder  
Finally **x** to run the extraction

**I do not trust you, but I am becoming curious. So?**

On **FreeBSD** [you can try to build the port (of paq, inside archivers)](https://www.freshports.org/archivers/paq) but it is very, very, very old (v 6.57 of 2014).  
You can get a "not too old" zpaqfranz with a `pkg install zpaqfranz`

On **OpenBSD** `pkg_add zpaqfranz` is usually up to date.

On **Debian** [there is a zpaq 7.15
package](https://packages.debian.org/zpaq), and starting with Debian
13 [zpaqfranz is available too](https://packages.debian.org/zpaqfranz).

You can download the original version (7.15 of 2016) directly from the author's website and compile it, or get the same from github.  
In this case be careful, because the source is divided into 3 source files, but nothing difficult for the compilation.  

**OK, let's assume I want to try out zpaqfranz. How?**  

From branch 51 all source code is merged in one zpaqfranz.cpp aiming to make it as easy as possible to compile on "strange" systems (NAS, vSphere etc).  
Updating, compilation and Makefile are now trivial.  

# How to build

My main development platforms are INTEL Windows (non-Intel Windows (arm) currently unsupported) and FreeBSD.

I rarely use Linux or MacOS or whatever (for compiling), so fixing may be needed.

As explained the program is single file, be careful to link the pthread library.  
You need it for ESXi too, even if it doesn't work. Don't be afraid, zpaqfranz knows!
