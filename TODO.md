### This is the todo list @ 2023-10-03 in no particular order

- [X] *Hard* Debian package. Ready, but I get an "overloaded" DD
- [X] *Hard* Fedora package. Almost ready, lost contact with Fedora maintainer
- [ ] *Mid* Update FreeBSD package. Not really a priority
- [X] *Hard* Implement the zpaq-over-TCP. Not easy, but all "pieces" already done => now SFTP support
- [ ] *Low* Complete and fix the wiki. I do not like very much english :)
- [ ] *Mid* XOR-ing SHA-1 to VFILE. Requires a lot of work to fix SHA-1 collisions
- [ ] *Hard* New file format without SHA-1. Backward compatibility will be broken. Not sure => not worth
- [X] *Low* "Automagically" define. In the source, but need more tests
- [X] *Low* Better low-memory extractor. For ESXi servers
- [X] *Low* Better proxmox backup. "Smarter hunter" of image's dataset
- [X] *???* Inspect -stdin with -fragment
